Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for analysing messages in my Whatsapp Group Chats

Started by a friend commenting he thought our plethora of Whatsapp Group chats had become "more haha-y" following a discussion about how much nicer it is to message people who respond to comical comments/content with 'haha' or its variants. Interested to know if he was right, I exported and parsed the data into Python and have continued to analyse the chats as a way of practising and learning a variety of machine learning classification techniques.
